		<h2>Popular Moonshots</h2>
		<h2><a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page">Bitcoin</a></h2>
		<p>Bitcoin (₿) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent
			from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.[7] Transactions are
			verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.
			The
			cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.[9]
			The
			currency began use in 2009[10] when its implementation was released as open-source software</p>

		<h2> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litecoin">Litecoin</a></h2>
		<p>Litecoin (LTC or Ł) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open-source software project released under the MIT/X11
			license. Litecoin was an early bitcoin spinoff or altcoin, starting in October 2011.[2] In technical details,
			Litecoin is nearly identical to Bitcoin.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namecoin">Namecoin</a></h2>
		<p>Namecoin (Symbol: ℕ or NMC) is a cryptocurrency originally forked from bitcoin software. It is based on the code
			of
			bitcoin and uses the same proof-of-work algorithm. Like bitcoin, it is limited to 21 million coins.[4]
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h2> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peercoin">Peercoin</a></h2>
		<p>Peercoin, also known as PPCoin or PPC, is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency utilizing both proof-of-stake and
			proof-of-work systems.

			Peercoin is based on an August 2012 paper which listed the authors as Scott Nadal and Sunny King. King, who also
			created Primecoin, is a pseudonym.[1] The Peercoin source code is distributed under the MIT/X11 software license.

			In the proof-of-stake system, new coins are generated based on the holdings of individuals. In other words,
			someone
			holding 1% of the currency will generate 1% of all proof-of-stake coin blocks. This has the effect of making a
			monopoly more costly, and separates the risk of a monopoly from proof-of-work mining shares.</p>

		<h2> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin">Dogecoin</a></h2>
		<p>Dogecoin (/ˈdoʊ(d)ʒkɔɪn/ DOHJ-koyn or DOHZH-koyn,[2] code: DOGE, symbol: Ð) is a cryptocurrency created by
			software
			engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system as a joke, making fun of the
			wild
			speculation in cryptocurrencies at the time.[3] Despite its satirical nature, some consider it a legitimate
			investment prospect. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the "Doge" meme as its logo and
			namesake.[4][5][6] It was introduced on December 6, 2013, and quickly developed its own online community, reaching
			a
			market capitalization of over $85 billion[b] on May 5, 2021.[7]

			Dogecoin.com promotes the currency as the "fun and friendly internet currency", referencing its origins as a
			joke.[8]

			Elon Musk frequently mentions or talks about Dogecoin on his Twitter account, boosting its popularity a
			significant
			amount in recent years.</p>
